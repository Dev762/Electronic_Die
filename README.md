# Electronic_Die

Dice is a squire type solid box which contains 6 different numbers on all of its sides. We throw dice on a surface to get a random number while playing the games. In this project we have tried to replicate it with a digital dice using arduino uno board. In place of throwing the dice, here we need to press a button to get a random number between 0 to 6.
A common anode seven segment display is used for displaying dice numbers, which is directly connected to arduino digital pin numbers
